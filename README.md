## Overview 
This project presents an interactive sales analysis dashboard for D*Mart, providing comprehensive insights into sales performance, order patterns, and customer behavior across different dimensions including time, geography, and product categories.

## Problem Statement
D*Mart, a leading retail chain, faces challenges in gaining comprehensive insights into its sales performance and customer behavior across multiple dimensions. The absence of a unified analytical framework makes it difficult to:
- Track and analyze monthly sales trends and seasonal patterns
- Understand regional performance variations across different states
- Identify top-performing product categories and their contribution to overall revenue
- Monitor payment method preferences and their impact on order status
- Calculate key performance indicators like Average Order Value and Return Rate
- Make data-driven decisions for inventory management and regional expansion


This dashboard aims to solve these challenges by providing an integrated view of sales data, enabling strategic decision-making and performance optimization.
